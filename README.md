# GMS v95 Decompilation

This is a decompiled project of the v95 client, based on the type information the class memory layout is reconstructed, with partially handwritten source code rewritten from REing and inline asm for other functions.

# Building instructions

Needs cmake and latest MSVC Compiler plus the original game files, checkout `copy_client_files.py` for copying the .wz files and .dll.

# State

So far the game boots into game and renders mostly fine
